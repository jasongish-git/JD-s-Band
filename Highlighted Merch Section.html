          <h2>Piano</h2>
          <p>A piano is a string instrument. It was invented in Italy around the year 1700. Unlike the saxophone or trumpet, a piano can play chords as well as single notes. It played a leading role in the development of ragtime, a style of music that eventually progressed to jazz. A musician playing the piano in a jazz band will commonly use his or her left hand to establish rhythm and the right hand to improvise melodies. Nat King Cole was a famous jazz singer and pianist who began performing at the age of four.</p>

          <h2>Saxophone</h2>
          <p>The saxophone is a woodwind instrument. In a jazz band most saxophone players also play other instruments such as the clarinet if there is a need for it. This instrument can be considered the most popular instrument in jazz music because of its unique sounds. Another unique feature of a saxophone is that it can produce just one note at a time. The saxophone instrument comes in various types which you can pick from, but baritone sax is the one that is commonly used. The most significant kind of sax is the bass max, and it was one of the first saxophones to be used in a jazz song.

        <h2>Trumpet</h2>
        <p>The trumpet is a very popular jazz instrument, likely because Louis Armstrong played the device a lot during his musical career. A member of the brass instrument family, the trumpet is one of the easiest jazz instruments to learn. It's played by blowing air into it through nearly closed lips, producing a buzzing sound that resonates through the instrument. Start with that method, keep practicing and before you know it you'll be growling and throwing in multi-phonics like the pros!</p>
