        <p>The saxophone is a woodwind instrument. Most Saxophone players also play other instruments such as the clarinet in a jazz band if there is a need for it. This instrument can be considered as the most popular instrument in jazz music because of its unique sounds.You also use a saxophone by pushing air into the mouthpiece. Another unique feature of a saxophone is that it can produce just one note at a time. The saxophone instrument comes in various types which you can pick from, but baritone sax is the one that is commonly used. The most significant kind of sax is the bass max, and it was one of the first saxophones to be used in a jazz song.

        <p>This is one of the very popular jazz instruments. The reason is not unconnected to the fact that Louis Armstrong played the device a lot during his musical career. You create the desired sound from a trumpet by blowing air into the mouthpiece. The trumpet and the piano are the easiest jazz instrument any beginner can learn.</p>
